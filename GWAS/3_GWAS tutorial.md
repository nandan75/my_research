## A tutorial on conducting genome‐wide association studies: Quality control and statistical analysis

- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/
- Discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial/ ).
- Also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis.
- The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands‐on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R.
- Aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.


  - Once you completed the current tutorial we recommend you to visit https://github.com/AngelaMinaVargas/eMAGMA-tutorial This Github repository guides the steps to use eMAGMA.
eMAGMA is a post-GWAS analysis, that conducts eQTL informed gene-based tests by assigning SNPs to tissue-specific eGenes.
