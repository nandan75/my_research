## Where does PRS fit in?

- Single variant association analysis requires very large sample sizes to detect more than a handful of SNPs for many complex traits 
What does the above statement mean?
- **Genome-wide association studies** (GWAS) aim to identify genetic variants that are associated with specific traits or diseases. In a GWAS, researchers typically compare genetic variations across the entire genome of individuals with and without a particular trait or disease to identify genetic markers that are more common in the affected group.

"Single variant association analysis" refers to the traditional approach in GWAS, where each genetic variant (usually single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) is individually tested for association with the trait of interest. This analysis examines the relationship between each SNP and the trait, typically using statistical tests such as logistic regression or chi-square tests.

- The statement highlights that single variant association analysis has been the primary method used in GWAS. However, it also points out a limitation of this approach: it requires very large sample sizes to detect more than a handful of significant associations between SNPs and complex traits.

- **Complex traits are influenced by** multiple genetic factors, as well as environmental and lifestyle factors, making them challenging to study. With single variant association analysis, it becomes harder to detect significant associations for complex traits due to several reasons:

- **Effect sizes**: Complex traits often involve multiple genetic variants with relatively small individual effect sizes. Detecting these small effect sizes requires larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance.

- **Multiple testing correction**: In GWAS, researchers perform statistical tests for millions of genetic variants. To account for multiple testing, stringent significance thresholds are applied, requiring a higher level of statistical evidence for declaring an association. This further increases the sample size needed to achieve sufficient statistical power.

- **Genetic heterogeneity**: Complex traits are often influenced by multiple genetic variants with diverse effects in different populations or subgroups. Detecting these heterogeneous effects requires larger sample sizes to capture the variation across populations.

Overall, while single variant association analysis has been the primary method in GWAS, it becomes more challenging to identify associations for complex traits without very large sample sizes. As a result, alternative methods and strategies, such as gene-based or pathway-based analyses, are being developed to complement single variant analysis and improve power in detecting genetic associations with complex traits.

### Polygenic Risc Score (PRS)
- PRS analysis does not aim to identify individual SNPs but instead aggregates genetic risk across the genome in a single individual polygenic score for a trait of interest.
- In this approach, a large discovery sample is required to reliably determine how much each SNP is expected to contribute to the polygenic score (“weights”) of a specific trait.
- To conduct PRS analysis, trait‐specific weights (beta's for continuous traits and the log of the odds ratios for binary traits) are obtained from a discovery GWAS. In the target sample, a PRS is calculated for each individual based on the weighted sum of the number of risk alleles that he or she carries multiplied by the trait‐specific weights.
- Although in principle all common SNPs could be used in a PRS analysis, it is customary to first clump (see clumping) the GWAS results before computing risk scores. p value thresholds are typically used to remove SNPs that show little or no statistical evidence for association (e.g., only keep SNPs with p values <0.5 or <0.1. Usually, multiple PRS analyses will be performed, with varying thresholds for the p values.
- A convenient program to perform PRS analysis is PRSice (see http://prsice.info/). It takes care of clumping, p value thresholds, MDS components, and plots attractive graphs. 
- Other programs for the application of PRS are, for example, PLINK (‐‐score) and LDpred (Purcell et al., 2007; Vilhjalmsson et al., 2015).
