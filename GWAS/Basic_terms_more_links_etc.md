## Potential-confounders 
  This can refer to the need to account for certain variables or factors that may influence the association between genetic variants and disease subtypes during genome-wide association analyses (GWAS). Here's what the sentence could mean in this context:

**Population structure**: Genetic variation can differ between populations due to factors such as ancestry, geographical location, or ethnicity. These differences can introduce bias in association analyses. Adjusting for population structure involves accounting for population-specific genetic variations, which can be done using statistical methods like principal component analysis (PCA) or including appropriate covariates in the analysis.

**Age**: Age is an important factor to consider because genetic associations with diseases can vary across different age groups. By adjusting for age, researchers can account for potential age-related effects and ensure that any observed associations are not solely driven by age differences between subgroups.

**Sex**: Some diseases or traits may have different prevalence, severity, or genetic risk factors based on biological sex. Adjusting for sex as a confounder helps to account for potential differences and identify sex-specific genetic associations with disease subtypes.

In summary, adjusting for potential confounders such as population structure, age, and sex in GWAS helps to minimize the influence of these factors on the observed genetic associations and ensures that any identified associations are more likely to be specific to the disease subtypes of interest rather than being confounded by these variables.
